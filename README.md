Problem :- format the visualization
1. Which is the combination of features causing the slowness ?
2. Which is the combination of features with value range causing the slowness ?
3. What is the accuracy of the result


   Approach :-

   for above problems
   visualization plot the distribution , corelation matrix, covariance matrix , boxplot and features importance technique

  Accuracy of the Result :
  Feature Importance: Use top features from random forest.
  Classification Models: Visualize accuracy for each model.



  Another Approach(not in code) :- use problematic_range from box_plot lower_fence and upper_fence and do further analysis
